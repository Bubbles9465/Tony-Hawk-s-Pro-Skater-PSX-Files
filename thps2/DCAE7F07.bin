What? You're 
still here? 






Go do something
productive...





For example...





Build a skatepark
and email it to: 

@b park_at_.bmp



Or you could start a home
safety program for your
school and neighborhood.





Whatever.









Help solve world hunger and 
clean up our oceans. 
Donate some money to 
the can-the-whales foundation.





Or...
 




Pick your lazy 
ass up off the 
couch and go skate! 





Sequel ideas?

@b thps_at_.bmp





But we're not paying you,
so don't ask.







Peace out.
